Responsibilities and contacts
=============================

This page documents administrative responsibility and contact information for the FOSS@RIT community.
Generally, there are two separate entities: **FOSS@RIT** and **FOSS@MAGIC**.

## FOSS@RIT

**FOSS@RIT** usually means the wider free/open source community at RIT.
This includes organizations and groups such as the following:

* [Free/Open Source Software initiative at RIT MAGIC Center](https://fossrit.github.io/about/)
* [RIT Linux Users Group](https://ritlug.com)
* [Computer Science House](https://www.csh.rit.edu/)
* [Sustainability at RIT](https://www.rit.edu/sustainability-at-rit)

However, the FOSS@RIT identity is not exclusive.
It is not "owned" by any single group or organization.
Generally, anyone who works in free/open communities at RIT, not limited to software, is included in this identity.

See Prof. Deejoe's blog post with suggestions on how to get involved with the FOSS@RIT community: [Joining RIT@FOSS](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225161814/http://deejoe.etrumeus.com/update/joining-ritfoss.html)

### Responsibilities
