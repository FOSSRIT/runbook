==================

This page explains what the FOSS@RIT Tech Team is, the responsibilities of the team, and where to contact the Tech Team.


## What is Tech Team?

The FOSS@RIT Tech Team is a group of FOSS@MAGIC staff, RIT faculty, students, and alums who support the infrastructure and digital services of the FOSS@RIT community.
The Tech Team was launched in Spring 2020, as part of an [open call for volunteers](https://fossrit.github.io/announcements/2019/12/17/spring-2020-volunteers/) for FOSS@MAGIC.
The team is volunteer-driven and loosely under the leadership of FOSS@MAGIC staff.
