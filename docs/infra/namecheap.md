Namecheap
=========

This page documents the use of a shared Namecheap account for FOSS@MAGIC.
This account is used to purchase and renew web domains associated with our community.


## Access

Unlike other services, a single, shared account is used for FOSS@MAGIC.
A single password is shared among FOSS@MAGIC payroll staff and some Tech Team volunteers to manage the account.
The account is registered to the `foss` [at] `rit` [dot] `edu` address.
Currently, this grants login access to the following people:

* [Brenda Schlageter](https://www.rit.edu/directory/bljbka-brenda-schlageter)
* [Justin W. Flory](https://justinwflory.com)
* [Stephen Jacobs](https://www.rit.edu/computing/directory/sxjics-stephen-jacobs)


## Registered domains

This section documents what domains are registered to the account and any active Domain Managers associated to a domain.
**Domain Managers** are other Namecheap accounts with some rights to manage and configure domains.
This is one way to share access to a domain _without_ sharing the password to the primary account.

### teleirc.com

* Expiration: **2022 May 7**

The `teleirc.com` domain is associated with the [TeleIRC project](https://github.com/RITlug/teleirc) managed by the [RIT Linux Users Group](https://ritlug.com).
This domain is managed by FOSS@MAGIC as a service to RITlug, since TeleIRC is an important part of the FOSS@RIT community infrastructure (see [Chat bridges](bridges)).
Currently there are two Domain Managers:

## Billing

FOSS@MAGIC covers the expenses for the domain renewals on as needed.
Namecheap is set up with automatic renewal to the RIT MAGIC Center via an RIT-managed credit card.
