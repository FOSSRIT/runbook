IRC (Freenode)
==============

This page documents the [Internet Relay Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat "Internet Relay Chat - Wikipedia") (IRC) infrastructure for the FOSS@RIT community.
Currently, this only includes our presence on the [Freenode](https://freenode.net/ "official Freenode website") IRC network.

## Cloaks

Cloaks are a type of "host mask" that replaces your IP address in IRC clients with a custom string of text.
The IRC protocol exposes your IP address or hostname by default when you join a channel.
When you authenticate with IRC's NickServ, a cloak replaces your IP address/hostname with the custom string.

Note that Freenode does not support the underscores (`_`) in cloaks.
Other non-alphanumeric characters may also not be supported and will be omitted from the cloak.

### Request a cloak

In order to receive a cloak, you must have completed the following steps:

1. Register your nick with NickServ
2. Set an email address with NickServ
3. Created an alternate nick and linked it to primary nick with NickServ

If you have not completed these steps, Freenode will not allow us to create your cloak.
For help doing these things, check out the [Nickname Registration help page](https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration "Nickname Registration - freenode") on Freenode's website.

Once you have completed the above steps, you can request a new cloak.
Request a cloak by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/tasks/issues/new) on the [FOSSRIT/tasks](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/tasks) repository.
