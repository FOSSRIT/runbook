Matrix
======

This page documents the use of the [Matrix.org network](https://matrix.org/) and [Riot chat client](https://about.riot.im/) in the FOSS@RIT community.
Matrix is a decentralized chat network while Riot is one (of many) possible clients for participating in the chat network.


## How we use Matrix

Matrix is convenient for us because it offers compatibility with existing IRC networks, such as Freenode.
Since the FOSS@RIT community was established on Freenode in 2010, we have a historical presence on IRC (see [IRC (Freenode)](irc)).
Matrix/Riot provides a modern user interface in a chat client and integrates nicely into existing IRC channels.
Many FOSS@RIT community members use the Matrix network, but can communicate seamlessly with IRC channels.

For help using Matrix/Riot, refer to the following links:

## RIT community

In 2017, [Riot.im announced communities](https://medium.com/@RiotChat/communities-aka-groups-are-here-announcing-riot-web-0-13-riot-ios-0-6-and-riot-android-0-7-4-933cb193a28e), a feature that groups rooms and users together (similar to a Slack team or a Discord server).
(Note eventually this will be replaced by [Groups-as-Rooms](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772).)
There is a RIT community on the `matrix.org` homeserver: `+rit:matrix.org` ([view on Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+rit:matrix.org "Click to open RIT community on Riot.im")).

The RIT community is owned by `@jflory7:matrix.org`.
At the time of writing, it is not possible to add other admins to communities.
